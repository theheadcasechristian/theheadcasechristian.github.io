    <h2>Faith in every moment of life.</h2>
    <p>Encouragement, reflections, and truth rooted in God’s Word.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>You aren’t looking for a "perfect" Christian life. You’re looking for a true one. If you’ve ever felt like you’re "too much" for the church pews—too loud, too traumatized, too skeptical, or just too overwhelmed—you belong here.</p>

<p>I’m Erin, and I spent a long time trying to be the "perfect" daughter of a deacon and Sunday School teacher. I know the pressure of the pedestal. But life? Life had other plans. Between a teen pregnancy, 18 years in an abusive marriage, navigating chronic illness, and managing a beautifully chaotic ADHD brain, I learned that God doesn’t live on a pedestal. He lives in the depths.</p>

<h3>Why This Blog Exists</h3>
<p>I’m a 47-year-old mother, a Georgia Bulldogs fan (Go Dawgs!), a recovery program leader, and a woman who refuses to pay full price for anything. But more than that, I am a seeker of proof.</p>

<p>I don't believe the Bible is a collection of "nice stories." I believe it is a historical and scientific powerhouse that holds up under the microscope of reality. This isn’t a place for blind faith; it’s a place for informed, battle-tested belief. We talk about it all here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Evidence:</strong> How history and science back the Word.</li>
  <li><strong>The Struggle:</strong> Navigating PTSD, ADHD, divorce, and the exhaustion of the "sandwich generation".</li>
  <li><strong>The Relationships:</strong> How to love people when it's hard, and how to set boundaries when necessary.</li>
  <li><strong>The Aftermath:</strong> What happens to your life once you decide to follow Christ (spoiler: it’s not always sunshine, but it is always worth it).</li>
</ul>

<h3>My "Signature" is the Scars</h3>
<p>I’ve been teaching the Word since I was 11 years old. I’ve led worship, run Bible studies, and worked in the trenches of recovery. But my greatest credentials aren't my titles—they are my scars.</p>

<p>I’ve walked through the valley of infertility, the sting of betrayal, and the daily grind of homeschooling and chronic pain. If I’ve learned anything, it’s the truth of Psalm 139:7-10:</p>

<blockquote>"If I make my bed in the depths, you are there... even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast."</blockquote>

<p>Whether you are in the heavens or the "depths" right now, I want you to know you aren’t alone, and you aren’t "crazy."</p>

<h3>A Few Things You Should Know About Me</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I’m a Dog Whisperer: I can’t keep a goldfish alive to save my life, but I can speak "Canine" fluently.</li>
  <li>I Know My Way Around a Garage: I might know more about your car than you do.</li>
  <li>I’m Inked: Yes, I have tattoos. No, they don't make me any less of a daughter of the King.</li>
  <li>I’m an ADHD Mind: This blog is a reflection of my brain—fast-moving, deeply curious, and covering a million topics because everything matters to God.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't expect every post to change your life, but I hope one does. I’ve written about everything from the science of the Resurrection to the reality of parenting a child with ADHD.</p>
